If you set stream_mode=\"updates\", you will get outputs in the format {node_id: output} — this means you know which node produced which output, and you can also detect special events like interrupts (they appear under the special key __interrupt__). This mode gives you full control if you want to handle things like human feedback, node tracking, or custom logic during the graph's execution. On the other hand, if you set stream_mode=\"values\", you will receive only the output values without knowing which node produced them — this makes the stream simpler and cleaner when you only care about the final results and don't need to manage interruptions or node-specific behavior. In short, use \"updates\" when you want full control and node awareness, and use \"values\" when you want only the results in a clean form"
